# M4_Challenge
# Task: evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios.
# As a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform, I need to choose portfolios with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.
# I am not sure I did it in a right way. Because I can't believe that based on the cumulative return information, none of the four fund portfolios managed to outperform the S&P 500 Index.
